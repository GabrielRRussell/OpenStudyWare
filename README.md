# OpenStudyWare
OpenStudyWare is a series of Python Libraries that are designed to help you study.

OpenStudyWare currently is under development, and isn't ready for practical use, although it is underway.

It contains a special file syntax, which is used to generate quizzes for users, so that anyone can create them. The file syntax goes as follows:

> Question|&correct answer|incorrect answer|incorrect answer|indefinite answer count

The first item in the line is the question, with subsequent answers being separated by a Pipe "|" character, and the correct answer being marked by an Ampersand "&" character.

I am also using it to randomly generate math questions that can be used to study.
